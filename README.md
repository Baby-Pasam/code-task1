Description: This Python program provides a simple command-line interface to manage a to-do list. It allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, remove tasks, and display the current list of tasks along with their completion status. The application is designed as an introductory project for learning Python programming, focusing on basic list operations and user input handling.

Features
Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list. Each task is stored as a dictionary with the task description and its completion status.
Complete Task: Users can mark tasks as completed by specifying the task number.
Remove Task: Users can remove tasks from the list by specifying the task number.
Show Tasks: Users can view all tasks with their current status (Done/Not Done).
Exit: Users can exit the application.
Program Functions
display_menu(): Displays the main menu with options for the user.
add_task(tasks): Prompts the user to enter a task description and adds it to the task list.
complete_task(tasks): Prompts the user to enter the task number to mark it as completed.
remove_task(tasks): Prompts the user to enter the task number to remove it from the list.
show_tasks(tasks): Displays all tasks along with their completion status.
main(): The main loop that keeps the application running, processing user inputs until the user chooses to exit.
Usage

conclusion  : The Simple To-Do List Application is a fundamental project that introduces key programming concepts in Python. Through this project, users learn how to manage a list of tasks by adding, completing, and removing tasks using basic list operations and dictionary handling. The program provides a straightforward command-line interface, making it easy to understand and interact with.

This application serves as a practical example of how to handle user input, manipulate data structures, and implement control flow in Python. It demonstrates the importance of creating user-friendly programs that address everyday needs, such as task management.

For beginners, this project offers a solid foundation in Python programming. It encourages further exploration into more advanced topics, such as persistent storage (e.g., saving tasks to a file), graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and web-based applications. By building upon this basic to-do list application, aspiring programmers can gradually develop more complex and sophisticated projects.

Overall, the Simple To-Do List Application is not just a tool for managing tasks; it is a stepping stone towards mastering Python and becoming proficient in software development.
